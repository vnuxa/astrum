[{"id":"0","title":"Documentation","content":"Documentation astrum is a widgeting system that depends on  libcosmic  it can run on any wayland compositor that supports the   protocol. astrum is made in rust and is configured in lua  i reccomend using the  lua language server  as that is what i will depend on for types  and i reccomend getting familiar with the annotation syntax as that is what i will show in documentation Installation since this project is still a work in progress,  you have to build it from source. if you use nix you can add this as a nix flake input and somewhere in your package list add the following I also recommend having the  lua language server  installed in your text editor, since it contains astrum types and descriptions Styling basics Since astrum depends on  , styling is done within lua and not in another language (css for example) Stylesheets Although the styling is done within lua, there still are stylesheets Each widget has its own styling model, though if a widget has multiple styling states (for example buttons   and  ) there is a   state as well, which overrides the base defaults, if not already specified You can use stylesheets within widgets via the   function Subscription basics Subscriptions are the only way to update your state and view logic after an external event occurs. \nSubscriptions will trigger  every  window's view and signal logic (might change in the future, depending on libcosmic) To use a subscription, you must subscribe to a specific service. \nHere is a hyprland workspace changed subscription example: Advanced subscriptions These subscriptions do not have predefined types that make it easy to understand on how to use it, which is why these will have to be further explained in the documentation Calls Calls is a powerful subscription that allows external proccesses to interact with astrum by sending a call signal. \nEach key in the calls subscription table will be the   and each value will be the name of the signal that will fire when it recieved the call signal This will display a widget that shows the amount of times that it has recieved the   call signal \nTo send this call signal, add   to the options of astrum (i.e.  ) You can also send data through the call by adding a   after the call signal name, though note that it has to be in valid lua table and executing the resulting command will result in the window text displaying the following Keybinds Custom keybinds in astrum are defined through subscriptions \nThe index of the keybind susbcription table will be the signal name that it will send to when the specified keys have been pressed. \nThe first parameter of the value table are the modifiers that need to be pressed, seperated by commas. \nThe second parameter is a single character or a lowercase name for the keybind (you can see the full list of named keys in the source of the keybind susbcription) \nAn example implementation: ::: {.note} keybinds will not work if the keymode is  ::: ","path":"astrum.html"},{"id":"1","title":"Option: astrum","content":"##### Modules","path":"options.html#option-astrum"},{"id":"2","title":"Option: astrum.widgets","content":"","path":"options.html#option-astrum-widgets"},{"id":"3","title":"Option: astrum.widgets:text","content":"","path":"options.html#option-astrum-widgets:text"}]
